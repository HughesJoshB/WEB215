				<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p> Born and raised in Ocean Isle Beach we have always had a draw to the ocean.
					Both our Captain and Co-Captain grew up surfing the local breaks on Ocean Isle Beach.
					Having fished from local ponds, the waterway and piers on days where the surf wasnâ€™t good
					we were still near the water. The chase of catching king mackerel started back in the 70's when Team Captain William 'Frollie' Hughes
					was in college at UNCW and catching kings of Johnny Mercer and Crystal Pier in Wrightsville Beach, NC.</p>
	
					<p> After fishing for 6 yrs. in the class of 23' and under with Teak Hemphill's Playing Hooky.
					Our captain ask his son if he wanted to fish some tournaments and offshore fish. Original fishing in a 19ft
					Pioneer with a 150HP Yamaha we entered some small tournaments here and there. While fun fishing
					during the October beach bite in South Eastern NC on the same weekend as the U.S. Open and catching a 40lb + fish,
					we looked at each other and said we were going to give a couple bigger tournaments a shot. The next year we fished
					the U.S. Open KMT and caught a 27.10 lb king that tied us for 55th place.</p>
		
					<p>In 2010 we decided that we were going to fish the SKA Division 9 Tournament Trail and went looking for a bigger boat to fish the open class. 
					From 2010 to 2014 we fished a 29ft Yellowfin, in the 1st tournament we fished in the open class Was the East
					Coast Got Em On and finished 14th. Then in 2014 we moved up to a 34ft Yellowfin powered by triple 300 Yamaha's.
					We have been able to fish from Morehead City, NC to Charleston, SC in local tournaments in both the SKA Division 9 and 3 trails.
					Along with going to the National Championship in Morehead City, NC and down in Biloxi, MS.</p>
	
				<h3> Our Boat </h3>	
					<p> In 2014 when we sold our 2010 29ft Yellowfin we went searching for another Yellowfin just a bigger
					model. After a couple months of looking, we happened to drive by Hankel Marine in Charleston, SC and saw
					34ft Yellowfin powered by triple 300hp Yamaha's. After some talking back an forth we became new owners of it.
					With it being a 2005 model and 3-owner boat we knew we were going to have some cosmetic work to be done, but only
					100hrs on the new motors along with new fuel tanks.</p>
					<p> In 2015	we contacted Live Wire Electronics in Myrtle Beach, SC about getting the boat re-wired. 
					We decided to get a new sound system via J.L. Audio, new gps and sonar from Garmin Marine. 
					Along with new vhf radio's from iCom America and a Fusion Entertainment receiver.</p>
				<h3>Tournament information</h3>
					<p> With having fished the Southern Kingfish Associations (S.K.A.) tournament trail since 2010
					in the Open class in both the Carolina's Division 9 and South Carolina Division 3 we have been able to
					experience new areas. We have fished in local tournaments from Morehead City, NC to Charleston, SC.
					We have been lucky enough to qualify for the Nationals all but 2 years during this time span.</p>
					<p> We have finished 3rd in Division 3 with a 2 fish total weight of 53.47lbs which also gave us 1st Place
					Senior Angler and 3rd place Lady Angler in 2015. In 2014 we finished 4th place overall, 1st place Lady Angler
					and 3rd place Senior Angler with a 36.25lb fish in the East Coast Got Em On out of Carolina Beach, NC.</p>
					<p> The 2017 Tournament season is scheduled to start June 16th with the Ocean Isle Fishing Centers' 
					Jolly Mon King Classic, which we finished 9th in 2016. We will be on the water and in a tournament
					somewhere in NC or SC at least 1 time a month until late Sept and early October when the NC Fall king beach
					bite takes off and have 5 tournaments in 7 weeks. Continue to follow us on social media either Twitter, Instagram
					Facebook for new updates, videos and pictures.</p>
